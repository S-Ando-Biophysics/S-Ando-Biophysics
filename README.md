# Profile
### Basic Information
- **Affiliation**: Biological Science Division, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Sophia University
- **Position**: 2nd year student of master's program
- **Degree**: Master of Science in Biological Science
- **Discipline**: Biophysics, Structural Biology, Nucleic Acid Science

### Research Theme
I focus on the analysis of nucleic acid three-dimensional structures at the atomic or molecular levels using biophysical techniques such as X-ray crystallograph (XRC). 

I have been advancing fundamental techniques for nucleic acid crystallization and structure determination, as well as conducting structural analyses of many nucleic acids, including a wide variety of modified nucleic acids. 

The purpose of my research is to apply these insights to structure-based drug design (SBDD) of novel nucleic acid therapeutics.
