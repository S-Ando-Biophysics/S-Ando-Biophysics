# Research Theme
I specialize in structural biology, focusing on the analysis of nucleic acid three-dimensional structures at the atomic and molecular levels using biophysical techniques such as X-ray crystallography. 

I have been advancing fundamental techniques for nucleic acid crystallization and structure determination, as well as conducting structural analyses of many nucleic acids, including a wide variety of modified nucleic acids. 

The purpose of my research is to apply these insights to structure-based drug design (SBDD) of novel nucleic acid therapeutics.
